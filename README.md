Business Problem & Sales & Revenue
1. The total revenue is ₹4.6M – which product contributes the most revenue, and why do you think it performs better than others?2
2. The average unit price is 22.55 – what insights can you derive about pricing strategy from this?

4. Which order type (In-store, Drive-Thru, Takeaway, Delivery) contributes the most sales, and how can Starbucks enhance customer experience in this area?
5. Looking at the payment method breakdown, Credit Cards (21%) are most used. What strategies could Starbucks use to promote mobile payments or gift cards?
6. The data shows high sales of Merchandise (Tumblers, Mugs). What does this indicate about customer behavior beyond food and beverage purchases?
7. Which product category (Beverage, Food, Merchandise) has the lowest quantity sold, and how could Starbucks boost its sales?
8. Based on the sum of unit price by payment method and order type, how can Starbucks create targeted offers (e.g., discounts for takeaway or mobile payments)?
9. If sales goals are exceeded by 2400%, what strategies should management take to sustain this growth?

Business Impact & Insights
* Starbucks is showing strong growth, premium positioning, and diversified revenue streams (coffee + food + merchandise). However, to stay competitive, Starbucks must reduce over-reliance on a few products, 
  expand digital channels, and balance sales across categories.
* Upsell & Cross-Sell: Pairing high-margin products (Tumblers, Coffee Beans) with beverages could increase basket size.
  Digital Transformation: Boosting Mobile App payments and Delivery services can improve convenience and strengthen loyalty programs.
  Diversification: Underperforming categories like Espresso, Mocha, Cold Brew need targeted promotions to balance product mix.
